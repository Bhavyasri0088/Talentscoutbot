Strengths
Basic Functionality Implemented: Your bot collects candidate information and generates technical questions

Streamlit UI: You've created a functional interface using Streamlit

GitHub Repository: You've provided source code with some documentation

Deployment: You've deployed the application (bonus points for this)

Areas for Improvement
1. User Interface (UI/UX)
Improvement: Make the UI more polished with better styling, consistent spacing, and professional colors

Current State: The UI is quite basic with minimal styling

Suggestion: Use Streamlit's layout options (columns, expanders) and add a logo/branding

2. Information Gathering
Improvement: Implement validation for email, phone number formats

Current State: Accepts any input without validation

Suggestion: Add regex patterns to validate contact information

3. Technical Question Generation
Improvement: Questions should be more specific to experience level

Current State: Generates generic questions regardless of years of experience

Suggestion: Adjust question difficulty based on experience (junior vs senior)

4. Context Handling
Improvement: Better conversation flow and context retention

Current State: Loses context between questions

Suggestion: Implement proper session state management

5. Fallback Mechanism
Improvement: Handle unexpected user inputs gracefully

Current State: May produce irrelevant responses to off-topic inputs

Suggestion: Add intent recognition before generating responses

6. Documentation
Improvement: Expand README with more technical details

Current State: README is quite minimal

Suggestion: Add:

Architecture diagram

Prompt engineering details

Setup instructions

Challenge/solution section

7. Data Privacy
Improvement: Add data handling disclaimer

Current State: No mention of data privacy

Suggestion: Include GDPR notice about data collection

8. Code Quality
Improvement: Better code organization and comments

Current State: Single file with minimal modularization

Suggestion: Split into modules (ui.py, prompts.py, utils.py)

Optional Enhancements (for Bonus Points)
Multilingual Support: Add language selection option

Sentiment Analysis: Gauge candidate emotions during conversation

PDF Report Generation: Create summary of candidate responses

Admin Dashboard: View collected candidate data

Database Integration: Store candidate responses properly
